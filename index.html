                <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
                <p>Born and raised in Madeira,
                   Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18. After winning the FA Cup in his first season, he helped United win three successive Premier League titles, the Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. In 2009, Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when
                   he signed for Real Madrid in a transfer worth
                    €94 million (£80 million)</p>
